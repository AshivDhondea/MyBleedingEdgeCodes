function [ Xdot ] = fnKepler3Augmented( t, X )
% fnKepler3Augmented implements implements the vector function F in 
% DX = FX as well as the state transition matrix's DE.

% We employ an augmented state vector: the first six elements in X are the
% states (x, y, z, xdot, ydot, zdot). The next 36 elements are the elements
% from the state transition matrix reshaped into a column vector.

%% Parameters

% X(1) == x i.e. x component of position
% X(2) == y i.e. y   "           "
% X(3) == z i.e. z   "           " 
% X(4) == xdot i.e. first derivative of x position
% X(5) == ydot i.e.                     y   
% X(6) == zdot i.e                      z

% The remaining 36 elements in X are the elements from the 6x6 state
% transition matrix reshaped into a column.

%% Calculations

mu = 398600;     % Earthâ€™s gravitational parameter [km^3/s^2]

% The state transition matrix's elements are the last 36 elements in the
% input state vector
Phi = reshape(X(end-36+1:end),6,6);% extract Phi matrix from the input vector X

% Find matrix A (state sensitivity matrix)

% We start with a matrix of zeros and then add in the non-zero elements.
